* cl-unicode

CL-UNICODE is a library which provides Common Lisp implementations
with knowledge about Unicode characters including their name, their
general category, the scripts and blocks they belong to, their
numerical value, and several other properties. It also provides the
ability to replace the standard syntax for reading Lisp characters
with one that is Unicode-aware and is used to enhance CL-PPCRE with
Unicode properties.
